# FibonacciVisualizer

Visualize the Fibonacci sequence, its ratios, and the Fibonacci spiral in Python.

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script that generates visualizations related to the Fibonacci sequence. It includes plots of the Fibonacci sequence, the ratios of consecutive Fibonacci numbers, and a graphical representation of the Fibonacci spiral.

## Getting Started

To run this project, ensure you have Python installed on your system. This project was tested with Python 3.8, but it should work with any Python 3.x version.

### Prerequisites

Before running the script, you'll need to install some dependencies. The required libraries are listed in the `requirements.txt` file. To install them, run:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To generate the Fibonacci visualizations, run the script with:

```bash
python fibonacci_visualizer.py
```

This will open a window displaying the plots. You can interact with the plots and save them using the matplotlib GUI.
